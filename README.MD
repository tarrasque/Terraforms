# Terraform templates

### Work in progress

Target of that repository is to store some minimal terraform templates for any cloud I'm using.

I can start with the following clouds:

* Azure  
* AWS
* GCP
* Contabo 

My goal is to generate a minimal instance as possible, and take note of any posible alternatives.<br>
Also, I would take some notes to the configuration settings for the instance, the IAM configuration required, and the networking rules.

Suggestions and collaborations are super welcome.ðŸ™‚<br>
Thanks for any suggestion related to imrpvements here.
